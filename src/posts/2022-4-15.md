# Reviewing methods for pulling and parsing markdown files for a blog

## Most Noteable options for rendering
|Parser | Discription|
|-------|------------|
|Marks | Markdown parser for general usage with many frameworks|
|react-markdown | a package containing react specific components |

### Primary needs
I want to minimize confusion during the rendering process while seemslessly untilizing the 
Bulma CSS framework. Lets begin testing...

### Testing results
after trying out react-markdown, I decided to go with it as my markdown renderer. It required minimal tinkering and resulted in a clean blog-post format.

## Storing and retrieving MarkDown files
I wanted to steer clear of using a database since I want this site to remain low-maintenance and simple to debug. The main point of this site is to showcase some skill in it's construction while showing more notable projects. Also, a good rule to follow is to not add complexity where it is not needed/desired.

### ... And as it turns out ...
The react framework use a file manager for modules and extension already: webpack. I just need to figure out the best way to use it within my app js.
