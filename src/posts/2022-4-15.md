# Reviewing methods for pulling and parsing markdown files for a blog

## Most Noteable options for rendering
|Parser | Discription|
|-------|------------|
|Marks | Markdown parser for general usage with many frameworks|
|react-markdown | a package containing react specific components |

### Primary needs
I want to minimize confusion during the rendering process while seemslessly untilizing the 
Bulma CSS framework. Lets begin testing...

### Testing results
after trying out react-markdown, I decided to go with it as my markdown renderer. It required minimal tinkering and resulted in a clean blog-post format.

## Storing and retrieving MarkDown files
I wanted to steer clear of using a database since I want this site to remain low-maintenance and simple to debug. The main point of this site is to showcase some skill in it's construction while showing more notable projects. Also, a good rule to follow is to not add complexity where it is not needed/desired.

### ... And as it turns out ...
The react framework use a file manager for modules and extension already: webpack. I just need to figure out the best way to use it within my app js.

code: 
```js
  state = {
    posts: []
  } 
  
  grabFileNames = async () => {
    console.log("Grabing posts");
    // Grab all filenames with extention ".md" from the posts dir under src using 'require' via webpack
    try{
      const importAll = (r) => r.keys().map(r);
      const markdownFiles = await Promise.all(importAll(require.context('../../posts',false, /\.md$/)) //the context module returns a function 
      .sort().reverse()).then(console.log("Files Listed"));
      
      return markdownFiles;
    }catch(err){console.log(err)}

  }
  
  componentDidMount = async () => {
    const markdownFiles = await this.grabFileNames();

    // Loop across the filenames using map, then fetch each file, then grab text, then store in array named 'posts'... ok?
    const posts = await Promise.all(markdownFiles.map((file) => fetch(file).then((res) => res.text())))
    .catch((err) => console.error(err))

    this.setState({
      posts: posts
    });
```
