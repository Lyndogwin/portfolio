# Problems with Testing

I have run into some issues with creating a testing environment for this application. The testing library packaged with CRA(create react app) is jest, which relies on Babel (the backbone of jsx) to transform non-standard js code into "valid" js. Unfortunately, the CRA configuration for jest does not include support for TypeScript (the language react markdown is written in) by default.

### Potential solutions
CRA docs include a method for adding TypeScript to an existing React App. We will try this method before exploring others.

Update:
